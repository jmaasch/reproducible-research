Use these questions to help you write an introductory blog about yourself. Aim for about a page worth of content. Use markdown to write your blog post. Here is a brief intro to Markdown (the first 13 slides are useful for now: https://laderast.github.io/magic-of-markdown)

* Tell us about yourself. Prompts: where you are from, what you do, what field are you in, any fun fact about yourself. The aim here is for our community to become well-acquainted with you.

* Why did you want to become a Fellow? Prompts: what are you hoping to learn? Any open science/reproducible research experiences?

* Why is improving research reproducibility important to you?

* Anything else youâ€™d like the Open Knowledge Foundation community to know about you?

* Please include a picture of you/an avatar either as a link or an image pasted into this document.
