**Tell us about yourself. Prompts: where you are from, what you do, what field are you in, any fun fact about yourself. The aim here is for our community to become well-acquainted with you.**

I am a Master’s Candidate and Interdisciplinary Innovation Fellow in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science. Prior to joining Penn Engineering, I was a life science professional with experience in molecular genetics and public health research. I am currently a Computational Researcher with the [Machine Biology Group](https://delafuentelab.seas.upenn.edu) at Penn Bioengineering and the Perelman School of Medicine. The Machine Biology Group integrates synthetic biology and artificial intelligence to build synthetic molecular tools and design novel therapies.

**Why did you want to become a Fellow? Prompts: what are you hoping to learn? Any open science/reproducible research experiences?**

I applied to be a Reproducible Research Fellow to make intentional space for delving deeper into open science and reproducibility issues. I value the community-minded design of this fellowship and its emphasis on disseminating knowledge through workshops and writing.

In my experience, rarely do data inconsistencies or poor documentation stem from malicious intent. Instead, a lack of exposure to tools and rigorous discourse on quality control, accountability, and reproducibility are often to blame. Research accountability and reproducibility often appear to be an honor system of common sense, based on assumptions about a researcher’s education and exposures. Opportunities like the Reproducible Research Fellowship can help rectify this problem. I am excited to give explicit attention to these urgent issues and to share what I learn with others. 

**Why is improving research reproducibility important to you?**

As a proponent of open source software, open access publishing, and open science more generally, I believe that scientists have a moral obligation to share their knowledge as widely and freely as possible. Further, I believe that we have a moral obligation to ensure that our findings can be vetted through replication studies and other important checks. Promoting open and reproducible research principles is essential not only to preserving integrity within the scientific community, but also to building scientific literacy, trust, and respect within society at large.
