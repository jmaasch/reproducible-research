## Looking back

It is hard to believe that my time as a Reproducible Research Fellow is over. I am most grateful for this program giving me a dedicated space in which to learn, a community with which to engage, and language with which to arm myself. I have been exposed to issues in open science that I had never encountered before, and I am grateful that door is open. I will miss the journal clubs the most! The conversations shared in this program inspired me to include an analysis of open science practices in a paper that I am preparing. This program also gave me my first opportunity to contribute to an open source project by workshopping docs and writing a Google Colab tutorial for the `frictionless` Python framework. 

## Looking forward

I intend to remain active in the open science community throughout my scientific career. I am excited to continue contributing to open source projects and to be vocal in my publications about standards of reproducibility.
