## Looking back

It is hard to believe that my time as a Reproducible Research Fellow is over. I am most grateful for this program giving me a dedicated space in which to learn, a community with which to engage, and language with which to arm myself. I have been exposed to issues in open science that I had never encountered before, and have had the priviledge of discussing these issues with people from across the world. I will miss the journal clubs the most!

The conversations that we have shared inspired me to include an analysis of open science practices within my field in a forthcoming publication. I would surely not have thought to do this analysis without the knowledge that I gained as a fellow. This program was also my first opportunity to contribute to an open source project, by workshopping docs and writing a Google Colab tutorial for the [`frictionless` Python framework](https://framework.frictionlessdata.io). To conclude my fellowship, I co-presented on [Frictionless Data tools](https://frictionlessdata.io) at [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com). 

I thoroughly enjoyed this 9-month debut into the worlds of open data, open source, and open access.

## Looking forward

This fall, I will start my PhD in Computer Science. I intend to remain active in the open science community as a doctoral student and throughout my scientific career. I will continue contributing to open source projects in my data science, machine learning, and software engineering communities. I will forever be vocal about standards of transparency and reproducibility in science. I hope to help clarify and strengthen these standards within my research community, as we face our own reproducibility crisis in machine learning for biomedical applications [[1]](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/586/eabb1655)[[2]](https://idp.nature.com/authorize/casa?redirect_uri=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2766-y&casa_token=7YMpxmLqxGgAAAAA:IwHzuUS9Ny1zPMYJ3khrwT2L6QmbIm_hH_XAzkQagtIxtilBGU3KzWI1YBLfh2CV-aYOo0Xkj4AXM2Yt)[[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00307-0)[[4]](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.2020200029).

Thank you to everyone at OKF for this formative and truly pleasurable opportunity!
