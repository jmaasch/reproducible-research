I am a Master’s Candidate, Interdisciplinary Innovation Fellow, and Reproducible Research Fellow in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science. Prior to joining Penn Engineering, I was a life science professional with experience in molecular genetics and public health research. I am currently a Computational Researcher with the Machine Biology Group at Penn Bioengineering and the Perelman School of Medicine.

* Why did you want to become a Fellow? Prompts: what are you hoping to learn? Any open science/reproducible research experiences?
